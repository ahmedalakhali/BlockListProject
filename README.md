# BlockListProject
 A small Windows utility written in C++ that uses ReadDirectoryChangesW for realâ€‘time folder monitoring and a periodic scanner. Hasher computes file hashes, Blocklist holds blocked hashes, and Logger writes detections to log.txt; run the program to monitor the files directory and add hashes to blocklist.txt to remove matches.

Lightweight Windows C++ utility to monitor a folder and detect files whose SHA-256 hashes appear in a blocklist.

---

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- Visual Studio 2019 / 2022 with "Desktop development with C++" workload (or MSVC toolchain)
- CMake 3.15+
- OpenSSL development libraries (the project uses OpenSSL for SHA-256)

This repository includes a `CMakeLists.txt` so you can build with Visual Studio or CMake.

---

## Recommended: Install OpenSSL using vcpkg (reproducible)

1. Clone vcpkg and bootstrap it:

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
   cd vcpkg
   .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
   ```

2. Install OpenSSL for your target triplet (example: x64):

   ```powershell
   .\vcpkg install openssl:x64-windows
   ```

3. Integrate vcpkg with Visual Studio (optional, makes includes/linking automatic):

   ```powershell
   .\vcpkg integrate install
   ```

4. When using CMake, pass the vcpkg toolchain file so CMake can find OpenSSL:

   ```powershell
   cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path\to\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake
   cmake --build build --config Release
   ```

Replace `path\to\vcpkg` with the absolute path to your cloned vcpkg directory.

---

## Alternative: Install OpenSSL manually

If you prefer not to use vcpkg:

- Install a prebuilt OpenSSL for Windows and note the include/lib directories.
- In Visual Studio, open the project properties and add the OpenSSL include path to "C/C++ ? Additional Include Directories" and the OpenSSL library path to "Linker ? Additional Library Directories". Add `libcrypto.lib` to "Linker ? Input ? Additional Dependencies".

Notes:
- Ensure the runtime architecture (x64 vs x86) matches the OpenSSL binaries you installed.
- When distributing the executable, include the matching OpenSSL runtime DLLs (e.g. `libcrypto-*.dll`) with the EXE or ensure they are installed on the target machine.

## Build and run (Visual Studio)

1. Open the generated solution (`build\FileBlockList.sln`) or open the provided `.vcxproj` in Visual Studio.
2. Set the configuration to `Release` and the platform to the same architecture used to install OpenSSL (e.g. x64).
3. Build the solution.
4. Create a `files` folder next to the executable and (optionally) edit `blocklist.txt` in the repo root. An empty `blocklist.txt` is fine.
5. Run the executable. A `log.txt` file will be created and updated as the scanner runs.

## Build and run (CMake + CLI)

1. Configure with CMake (example using vcpkg toolchain):

   ```powershell
   cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path\to\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake
   ```

2. Build:

   ```powershell
   cmake --build build --config Release
   ```

3. Run the produced `FileBlockList.exe` from `build\Release` (or from Visual Studio).

## Runtime notes

- The program expects a `files` directory (relative to working directory) and a `blocklist.txt` file in the working directory. The repo includes a placeholder `blocklist.txt`.
- `log.txt` is generated by the application; it is ignored by `.gitignore` to avoid noisy commits.
- The monitor code uses the Windows API (`ReadDirectoryChangesW`) so this project targets Windows only.

---

## CI

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that bootstraps `vcpkg` on the runner and installs OpenSSL (`openssl:x64-windows`) before calling CMake. The workflow then configures CMake with the vcpkg toolchain so OpenSSL is found automatically and the project builds on `windows-latest`.

---

## Troubleshooting

- "unresolved external symbol" for OpenSSL functions: make sure the OpenSSL libraries are in the Linker settings and the correct architecture is selected (x64 vs x86).
- "byte: ambiguous symbol" or similar: avoid `using namespace std;` in headers (this repo's headers have been updated to qualify `std::` types).
- OpenSSL runtime DLL missing at execution: include the matching OpenSSL DLLs alongside the EXE or install OpenSSL runtime on the target machine.
- If the build fails on CI, check workflow logs — the workflow now installs vcpkg and OpenSSL, so most builds should succeed by default.
