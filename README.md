# BlockListProject
A small Windows utility written in C++ that uses ReadDirectoryChangesW for realâ€‘time folder monitoring and a periodic scanner. Hasher computes file hashes, Blocklist holds blocked hashes, and Logger writes detections to log.txt; run the program to monitor the files directory and add hashes to blocklist.txt to remove matches.
